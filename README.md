Project Overview:

This project leverages Power BI to analyze investment preferences and behaviors based on the dataset Data_set 2.csv, which includes responses from 40 individuals about their investment choices, savings objectives, and related factors. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis, visualize trends, and derive actionable insights through a series of tasks, culminating in an interactive dashboard. The project explores demographic patterns, investment objectives, reasons for investment, monitoring habits, and information sources, providing a comprehensive view of investor behavior.

Overall Insights for Decision-Making

1. Targeting Young Investors with Growth-Oriented Products

The analysis highlights a young investor base with an average age of 27.8 years, showing a high investment adoption rate of 92.5%, which reflects strong financial engagement among mid-career professionals. Mutual Funds dominate as the top investment choice at 43.24%, driven by trust in diversified, professionally managed portfolios, particularly among those prioritizing Capital Appreciation at 29.73% and Growth at 10.81%, with Better Returns being a key motivator for Mutual Fund investors. To leverage this trend, financial institutions should prioritize promoting Mutual Funds as the flagship product for young investors, emphasizing their growth potential and professional management to align with the preferences of this demographic.

2. Prioritizing Retirement and Healthcare in Financial Planning


Retirement emerges as the overwhelming savings priority at 59.46%, even among this young demographic, followed by Healthcare at 35.14%, indicating a forward-thinking approach to financial planning among Millennials and Gen Z. Despite their youth, these investors are already focusing on long-term goals, with Education lagging at only 5.41%, likely due to their current life stage as childless professionals. Financial institutions should center their offerings on retirement products like NPS and pension plans, while also incorporating health-linked riders such as critical illness cover to address the secondary priority of healthcare, ensuring products resonate with these key savings objectives.

3. Balancing Investment Durations and Monitoring Habits

Investors show a clear preference for medium to long-term commitments, with 47.50% opting for 3-5 year durations and 45.00% for 1-3 years, while short-term (less than 1 year at 5.00%) and very long-term (more than 5 years at 2.50%) investments are rare. Monthly monitoring is the norm for 29 respondents, particularly for low-risk avenues like Fixed Deposits and PPF, though Equity and Mutual Fund investors engage more actively with weekly or daily checks due to their volatile nature. Financial institutions should design investment products with 1-5 year durations to match these preferences and provide monitoring tools, such as mobile apps for active investors and periodic updates for passive ones, to cater to varying engagement levels.

4. Understanding Reasons for Investment Across Avenues

Capital Appreciation leads as the primary reason for investment at 18.75%, particularly for Equity, reflecting a strong growth focus among investors, while Fixed Deposits are chosen for their Risk-Free attributes and Government Bonds for Assured Returns, emphasizing safety as a key driver for these avenues. Mutual Funds are driven by Better Returns at 15.00%, aligning with their diversified, growth-oriented nature. Financial institutions should highlight growth potential in marketing Equity and Mutual Funds, while emphasizing safety and guaranteed returns for Fixed Deposits and Government Bonds, ensuring messaging aligns with the primary motivations for each investment type.

5. Addressing Gender-Based Preferences and Risk Profiles

Gender trends reveal distinct preferences, with males leaning towards safety, favoring PPF at 35% and Fixed Deposits at 17.5%, and prioritizing Capital Appreciation at 19.00%, while females exhibit greater risk aversion, ranking Equities lower at 5.20 compared to males at 4.33, and favoring Mutual Funds with a 2.73 average ranking, valuing both Better Returns and Capital Appreciation equally at 18.33%. To address these differences, financial institutions should offer males safer, tax-efficient options like PPF and Fixed Deposits, while promoting Mutual Funds to females as a balanced choice that aligns with their preference for diversified growth and returns, tailoring strategies to these gender-specific risk profiles.

6.Leveraging Trusted Information Sources for Outreach

Financial Consultants are the most relied-upon information source at 40%, followed by Newspapers and Magazines at 35%, with males showing a stronger preference for consultants, likely due to their higher representation (25 males vs. 15 females), while digital sources like the Internet lag at 10%. This indicates a preference for professional and traditional media over digital channels among this investor group. Financial institutions should partner with financial consultants to build trust and reach investors effectively, leverage traditional media for broad outreach, and simultaneously invest in digital platforms to capture younger, tech-savvy investors over time, ensuring a multi-channel approach that aligns with current information-seeking behaviors.
